title: What is Intelligence?
---

As the name *Artificial Intelligence* suggests, the study of AI is heavily based in the definition of the word *Intelligence*. Before trying to, in a sense, copy human intelligence into a machine, we must first understand human intelligence itself. This task is not as easy as it might sound at first. In fact, psychologists have been studying this concept for centuries. Over the years, many different definitions have been proposed, from umbrella definitions trying to encompass what it means to be *smart*, to fractured definitions in which multiple types of intelligence are identified. In this post, I will be giving an overview of the history of the study of human intelligence, and what implications each different definition has for the modern day study of AI.

The psychology of intelligence, as with many psychological topics, is centred around a *nature vs. nurture* debate. What his means is that psychologists studying intelligence plague themselves with the question of whether intelligence is inherited (part of our *nature*),  or learned (can be *nurtured*).
