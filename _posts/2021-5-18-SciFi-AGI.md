title: AI: Science Fact vs. Science Fiction
---

When people think about Artificial Intelligence, they tend to refer to science fiction – A few examples include the Terminator, JARVIS from Iron Man,  and Marvin from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. But how close are these sci-fi interpretations to reality?

The major point of disconnect between AIs in sci-fi and real AI is the size of their intelligence application space. What I mean by this is that the AI in movies tend to have what is called *general intelligence*, the ability to act intelligently in a wide range of situations, just as humans do.  Conversely, real-life AI has what is called *narrow intelligence*, meaning that the AI can act intelligently in a single type of situation, but not in all types of situations. For example, one of the current cutting-edge AIs is Google’s AlphaZero, the world grand-master at the game of Go (a strategy game similar to chess). While no human has successfully beaten this AI in the game of Go, anyone could easily beat this AI in a game of checkers. Another example is Softbanks’s humanoid robot named Pepper, a greeting and information bot which is able to recognize human emotions based on facial expression. While it is able to understand the complexities of human facial expression, Pepper can not recognize any other visual characteristics, such as race, gender, height, etc. A final examples is Google’s DeepMind breast cancer detector, which outperforms human radiologists at detecting breast cancer, but would not be able to detect the presence of any other type of cancer or illness. These examples demonstrate the current state of AI – we are able to build machines that are very intelligent with respect to a single problem space, but we cannot build a machine with even toddler-level generalized intelligence.

To sum up, we have established that the AI in sci-fi displays general intelligence, while the AI in real life does not. However, researchers in the philosophy of intelligence, as well as the cognitive and computer sciences, are currently attempting to take steps towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence. When reasoning about AGI, two main paths tend to be identified – one is to replicate the structure of the human brain, and the other is to create some functional equivalent to the human brain with different structure. When reasoning about either path, there are three major barriers that arise. The first is the fact that the human brain has not been fully mapped by neuroscience – there are still many things about brain functioning and structure that we do not understand. Second is the fact that the computational “neurons” used in neural networks are not the same as biological neurons –  computational neurons are much simpler, and thus are not able to convey as much information per neuron as biological neurons are able to.  In addition, biological neurons are much faster and more energy efficient than computational ones. Thus, biological neurons can carry more information in less time using less energy compared to computational ones. Finally, there is the issue of computing power – the human brain is estimated to operate at 1 exaFLOP, which means it can perform one billion billion calculations per second; the fastest supercomputer in the world, named Fugaku, operates at 415.5 petaFLOPs, approximately 42% of the computing power of the human brain. It is also interesting to note that Fugaku is an extremelly large machine, filling a large room with hardware, therefore is nowhere near as space-efficient as the human brain. Thus, even if we were able to map the entire brain, and accurately computationalize biological neurons, we still do not have the hardware to make this possible.

While these barriers may make it seem that AGI is a fully unachievable goal, there is still hope for achieving AGI – after all, most technological innovations seemed impossible before they were realized. In fact, many such innovations were actually inspired by science fiction – for instance, the original Star Trek TV series from the 1960’s, is often cited as inspiration for the development of Bluetooth headsets, cell phones,  and touch-screen tablets. On a darker note, the Skynet from Terminator, an AI whose goal is to extinguish humanity, is eerily similar to the US Army ATLAS AI – an automated system for acquiring, identifying, and targeting threats. That is to say, we may be able to build AGIs like JARVIS from Iron Man, Marvin from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, or the Terminator at some point in the future, but only after massive innovation in neuroscience, neural network building practices, and super-computing technology.
