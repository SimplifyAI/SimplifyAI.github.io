I created this blog with the goal of educating the general public about interesting topics in Artificial Intelligence. This topic is currently a very popular one, but it is also very misunderstood. AI is permeating many aspects of our lives, and I believe it is important that we all understand what it means to trust these systems. From the technology industry to science fiction, AI is often misrepresented as having true intelligence - I aim to demonstrate why this is not the case, and why it may be dangerous to believe this misrepresentation. AI is certainly a useful tool, but that is all it is - there are no robot overlords on the horizon.
